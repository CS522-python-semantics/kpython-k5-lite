Before using our kpython semantics, please install any version of python3 and the latest version of K 5.0 framework (No later than {Nightly build of K framework at commit dd95c2d}) on your computer.

Usage:

1. make all: Compile the project.

2. make clean: Remove the compiled kpython binaries.

3. make tests: Run the tests inside the ./test folder. The output file will be put in the ./tmp folder

4. make test-clean: Remove the output files in the ./tmp folder.
